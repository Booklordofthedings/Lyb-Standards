# Lyb-Standards
There is no official standard for beef code and projects yet, outside of a simply doing it mostly how c# does it.  
I wanted to make my own unofficical standards for beef projects, for both code, and files.  
No one needs to follow these, but I think they make for a good baseline and readable code.  
There are reasons even someone who wants to follow these standards cant do that and thats fine.
